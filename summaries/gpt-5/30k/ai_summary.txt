Comprehensive Architectural Summary – PartsUnlimited MRP (Merged from 6 chunks)

1) System Overview and Purpose
- Domain: Fictional Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) application for DevOps training and microservice patterns.
- Core runtime services:
  - Web UI (Clients): Static WinJS single-page app (SPA) packaged as a WAR (mrp.war) and served via Tomcat.
  - Ordering/OrderService: Spring Boot REST API managing Catalog, Dealers, Quotes, Orders, Shipments; persists to MongoDB (with optional PostgreSQL schema provided).
  - IntegrationService: Spring Boot background integration that bridges Azure Storage Queues (“orders”, “product”) and the Ordering API, performing asynchronous ingestion and synchronization.
  - Database: MongoDB database “ordering” (and “orderingtest” for tests), seeded via MongoRecords.js.
- Training/DevOps samples (non-core):
  - Python CI example (Travis CI).
  - Flask app + Locust load testing.

2) Technologies, Frameworks, and Build Artifacts
- Languages/Frameworks:
  - Java 8, Spring Boot/MVC, Spring Data MongoDB.
  - WinJS (Windows Library for JavaScript), DateJS for date parsing.
- Build:
  - Gradle wrappers (OrderService: 2.1; IntegrationService: 1.11; Clients: Gradle).
  - CI via Travis CI builds all modules.
- Artifacts:
  - Clients WAR: mrp.war.
  - OrderService JAR: ordering-service-0.1.0.jar (also deployable as WAR via SpringBootServletInitializer).
  - IntegrationService JAR: integration-service-0.1.0.jar.
- Telemetry/filters:
  - Application Insights via AppInsightsFilter (requests/exceptions) and Mongo dependency telemetry (RemoteDependencyTelemetry).
  - CORS: SimpleCORSFilter (permissive).
- Optional PostgreSQL: schema file provided; properties exist, but active repositories are Mongo-backed.

3) Component Architecture and Responsibilities

A) Web UI (Clients)
- Static WinJS SPA hosted on Tomcat 7.
- Navigation and shell:
  - Application.PageControlNavigator (navigator.js) for page lifecycle.
  - default.js provides app bootstrapping, progress overlay, modal popup, confirm/report error dialogs, two-way binding initializer, and Google Places helpers.
- Configuration:
  - serverconfig.js sets baseAddress: "http://" + window.location.hostname + ":8080".
- Functional pages (WinJS.UI.Pages) with Data module interactions:
  - Main: launch tiles.
  - Catalog: list/create/update/delete catalog items.
  - Dealers: dealer CRUD with Google Places address autocomplete.
  - Quotes: quote CRUD, search by name; manage “Extras” via modal; navigate to Orders.
  - Orders: create from quote; manage order lifecycle/status; view/manage events via modal; navigate to Deliveries.
  - Deliveries: create from order; manage shipment details and events; extras via quote.
  - Extras (modal): manage additional items tied to quotes or deliveries (works against catalog).
  - Order Events (modal): add/remove order events; sorted by date descending (robust to pre-1970 dates).
- Data service (global Data module, not shown, but used APIs):
  - Catalog: catalogGet/Create/Save/Delete, catalogFindSku.
  - Dealers: dealersGet, dealerCreate/Save/Delete.
  - Quotes: quotesGet, quoteCreate/Save/Delete, quoteGetById.
  - Orders: ordersGet, orderCreate, orderCreateFromQuote, orderSave/Delete, orderFindById.
  - Deliveries: deliveriesGet, deliveryCreateFromOrder, deliverySave/Delete, deliveryFindById, orderGetById.
- UI notes:
  - Uses WinJS.Binding.List and backingData for serialization.
  - Injects related entities for display (__quote, __order) while persisting by ids.
  - Uses DateJS for human-readable timestamps.
  - Assumes ContentDialog elements #confirmdialog and a progress overlay.

B) OrderService (Spring Boot)
- Exposes JSON REST endpoints for Catalog, Dealers, Quotes, Orders, Shipments, and a health/ping endpoint.
- Storage abstraction via RepositoryFactory:
  - Backends: in-memory (“memory”) and MongoDB (“mongodb”; default).
  - Static service locator style with reset(storage) used by tests and runtime configuration.
- Controllers and routes:
  - CatalogController (/catalog):
    - GET /catalog → 200 with list or 404 if empty.
    - GET /catalog/{sku} → 200 or 404.
    - POST /catalog → 201 Created; 400 on validation; 409 Conflict if duplicate.
    - PUT /catalog/{sku} → 200 on update; 404 if not found; 400 on validation.
    - DELETE /catalog/{sku} → 204 or 404.
  - DealerController (/dealers):
    - GET /dealers → 200 with list or 404 if empty. Note: intentionally loops 100000 repository calls for APM demo load.
    - GET /dealers/{name} → 200 or 404.
    - POST /dealers → 201/200 on create/update; 400 on invalid; 409 on duplicate.
    - PUT /dealers/{name} → 200 or 404; 400 on validation.
    - DELETE /dealers/{name} → 204 or 404.
  - QuoteController (/quotes):
    - GET /quotes/{id} → 200 or 404.
    - GET /quotes?name={filter} → 200 with list or 404 if none.
    - POST /quotes → 201 Created with Location; server generates random positive int id when missing; 400 on duplicate/validation; 409 not used here.
    - PUT /quotes/{id} → 200 or 404; 400 on validation.
    - DELETE /quotes/{id} → 204 or 404.
  - OrderController (/orders):
    - GET /orders/{id} → 200 or 404.
    - GET /orders?dealer={name}&status={OrderStatus} (both optional; None means no status filter) → 200 with list or 404 if none.
    - POST /orders?fromQuote={quoteId} → 201 Created with Location; 409 Conflict if an order already exists for the quote; 400 on bad request (e.g., quote missing).
    - POST /orders/{id}/events → 201 Created; controller stamps current date; 400 if not found.
    - PUT /orders/{id} → 200 or 404; 400 on validation.
    - PUT /orders/{id}/status → 200; updates status and appends an event with current date; 400 if not found.
    - DELETE /orders/{id} → 204 or 404.
  - ShipmentController (/shipments):
    - GET /shipments?status={OrderStatus default None} → 200 with list or 404 if none.
    - GET /shipments/deliveries → 200 with list of Delivery (shipment+order+quote) filtered by DeliveryConfirmed (inferred) or 404 if none.
    - GET /shipments/{orderId} → 200 or 404.
    - POST /shipments → 201 Created; requires existing order; rejects duplicate per order; 400 on invalid/duplicate; 409 Conflict may be used by repos.
    - PUT /shipments/{orderId} → 200 or 404; 400 on validation or id mismatch.
    - POST /shipments/{orderId}/events → 200 OK if appended; 201 Created otherwise; 400 on validation; 404 if shipment not found.
    - DELETE /shipments/{orderId} → 204 or 404.
  - PingController (/ping):
    - HEAD /ping → 200 liveness.
    - GET /ping → returns ordering.pingMessage, ordering.validationMessage, build.number, build.timestamp from buildinfo.properties.
- Domain models (service DTOs) and validation:
  - CatalogItem: skuNumber, description, price, inventory, leadTime; validate() sku/description. For Mongo reads, leadTime is 0 when inventory > 0.
  - DealerInfo: name (required), contact, address, email, phone.
  - Quote: quoteId, validUntil, customerName (required), dealerName (required), city, postalCode, state, totalCost, discount, quoteItems: [QuoteItemInfo], plus additional descriptive fields used by client.
  - QuoteItemInfo: skuNumber, amount (Comparable by skuNumber).
  - Order: orderId (“order-” + quoteId), quoteId (required), orderDate (required), status (enum: None, Created, Confirmed, Started, Built, DeliveryConfirmed, Shipped, Delivered, Installed), events: [OrderEventInfo].
  - OrderEventInfo: date, comments.
  - OrderUpdateInfo: status, eventInfo; controller sets date at update time.
  - ShipmentRecord: orderId (required, 1:1 with order), deliveryDate (required), deliveryAddress (validate city+postalCode), contactName (required), PhoneInfo primaryContactPhone (required), alternateContactPhone, events: [ShipmentEventInfo].
  - ShipmentEventInfo: date, comments (required).
  - Delivery: aggregate DTO (ShipmentRecord + Order + Quote) for deliveries view.
- Repository interfaces:
  - CatalogItemsRepository, DealersRepository, QuoteRepository, OrderRepository, ShipmentRepository with get/getById, create/update/upsert, remove, and list/query methods (see endpoints above).
- Repository implementations:
  - In-memory (mock) for unit tests and “memory” mode:
    - Pre-populated catalog; quote create generates id if missing; order create enforces 1:1 with quote; shipment create enforces 1:1 with order; case-insensitive dealer/SKU handling where applicable.
  - MongoDB-backed:
    - Collections and models:
      - catalog: mongodb.models.CatalogItem (id, indexed skuNumber, description, price, inventory, leadTime).
      - dealers: mongodb.models.Dealer (id, indexed name, contact, address, email, phone).
      - quotes: mongodb.models.QuoteDetails (id, indexed quoteId, indexed dealerName, validUntil, customerName, totalCost, discount, city, postalCode, state, quoteItems[]).
      - orders: mongodb.models.OrderDetails (id, indexed orderId, indexed quoteId, orderDate, indexed status, events[]).
      - shipments: mongodb.models.ShipmentDetails (id, indexed orderId, deliveryAddress embedded, contactName, primaryContactPhone, alternateContactPhone, events[]).
    - Cross-repo logic:
      - QuoteRepo upserts Dealer if missing.
      - OrderRepo requires existing Quote; rejects duplicate per quote; filters by dealer via QuoteRepo.getQuoteIdsByDealerName.
      - ShipmentRepo requires existing Order; enforces single shipment per order; filters shipments by associated order status.
    - MongoOperationsWithRetry:
      - Wraps MongoOperations with telemetry per operation and a single retry on DataAccessResourceFailureException with SocketTimeoutException.
      - Operations covered: dropCollection, findAll, findOne, exists, find, findAndRemove, insert, save.
- Cross-cutting:
  - AppInsightsFilter: request telemetry (duration, code) and exceptions; TelemetryClient is thread-local; instrumentationKey from properties.
  - SimpleCORSFilter: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * and standard headers.
  - Build info injection via Gradle buildSrc for buildinfo.properties.
- Configuration (application.properties):
  - server.port: 8080.
  - management.port: 8081 (Actuator) with management.address: 127.0.0.1.
  - ordering.storage: mongodb (or memory).
  - ordering.pingMessage, ordering.validationMessage (e.g., version string).
  - mongodb.host: localhost (supports comma-separated list).
  - mongodb.database: ordering.
  - PostgresqlProperties present for alternative storage (driver/url/username/password).

C) IntegrationService (Spring Boot)
- Purpose: Bridge Azure Storage Queues and OrderingService API.
- Scheduling: Two fixedDelay tasks every 30 seconds.
- Queue integration (Azure Storage SDK com.microsoft.azure:azure-storage:2.0.0):
  - application.properties:
    - azure.storage.connectionstring: DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=...;AccountKey=... (security risk: checked-in secret).
    - azure.storage.queue.orders: orders.
    - azure.storage.queue.inventory: product.
    - azure.storage.queue.message: 300 (visibility timeout seconds).
  - QueueFactory caches CloudQueue instances in a ConcurrentHashMap; provides QueueService abstraction.
- Ordering API client (MrpConnectService) base URL: mrp.endpoint (default http://127.0.0.1:8080/).
- Processing flows:
  - Orders ingestion:
    - Poll “orders” queue; for each OrderMessage:
      - POST /quotes (creates Quote; returns quoteId).
      - POST /orders?fromQuote={quoteId} (creates Order; returns orderId).
      - POST /shipments (creates ShipmentRecord from OrderMessage and orderId; deliveryDate = today + 14 days).
      - On success, delete the message; malformed JSON messages are logged and deleted. At-least-once semantics; no idempotency key or retry/backoff beyond queue semantics.
  - Inventory export:
    - GET /catalog (CatalogItem[]); transforms to ProductMessage (productList of skuNumber, inventory, leadTime) and enqueues to “product”.
- Models:
  - Website messages: OrderMessage (customerName, dealerName, orderDate, address, country, phone, city, postalCode, state, totalCost, discount, items: List<OrderItem {skuNumber, price}]); ProductMessage (List<ProductItem {skuNumber, inventory, leadTime}]).
  - MRP models (duplicated DTOs matching OrderService schemas): Quote, QuoteItemInfo, Order, ShipmentRecord, DeliveryAddress, PhoneInfo, CatalogItem.
- Logging: logging.file=integration-service.log; logging.level.org.springframework.web=INFO.

4) Data Models and Persistence Schemas

A) MongoDB (primary store)
- Database: ordering (and orderingtest for tests).
- Collections and exemplar fields:
  - catalog: { skuNumber, description, price, inventory, leadTime }.
  - dealers: { name, contact, address, email, phone }.
  - quotes: { quoteId, validUntil ISO string, customerName, dealerName, totalCost, discount, city, state, postalCode, quoteItems: [{ skuNumber, amount }] }.
  - orders: { orderId, quoteId, orderDate ISO string, status string/enum, events: [OrderEventInfo] }.
  - shipments: { orderId, contactName, primaryContactPhone { phoneNumber, kind }, alternateContactPhone, deliveryAddress { street, city, state, postalCode, specialInstructions }, deliveryDate ISO string, events: [ShipmentEventInfo] }.
- Seed data via deploy/MongoRecords.js (used by VM and Docker deployments).

B) PostgreSQL (alternative schema in scripts/schema.psql)
- Tables:
  - CatalogItems, Dealers, Quotes, QuoteAdditionalItemRecord, Orders, OrderEvents, PhoneInfo, DeliveryAddress, ShipmentRecords, ShipmentEventInfo.
- Not used by default; provided for educational alternate storage.

5) External Interfaces and Endpoints

A) OrderService REST (JSON)
- Catalog, Dealers, Quotes, Orders, Shipments, Ping endpoints as detailed in section 3B.
- Status code conventions:
  - 200 OK for successful reads/updates, 201 Created for creations, 204 No Content for deletes.
  - 400 Bad Request on validation or duplicate quotes/shipments in some cases.
  - 404 Not Found when entity/list empty (list endpoints often 404 if empty).
  - 409 Conflict on duplicate Catalog POST and Order creation from an already-used quote.
- CORS open; no authentication/authorization in code.

B) IntegrationService REST calls (to OrderService)
- POST /quotes, POST /orders?fromQuote={id}, POST /shipments, GET /catalog.

C) Web UI calls (via Data module)
- Maps to OrderService endpoints; baseAddress “http://<host>:8080”.

6) Service Dependencies and Communication Patterns
- Web UI → OrderService: Synchronous HTTP/JSON; browser-side with CORS allowed.
- IntegrationService ↔ Azure Storage Queue: Polling model; processes orders queue and publishes product queue.
- IntegrationService → OrderService: Synchronous HTTP calls to create Quote → Order → Shipment pipeline and to fetch catalog.
- OrderService → MongoDB: Spring Data MongoTemplate via MongoOperationsWithRetry (telemetry + retry on socket timeouts).
- Optional external: Azure Application Insights telemetry sink (instrumentationKey configured via properties/environment).

7) Deployment Topologies and IaC

A) VM-based (Azure/Azure Stack)
- ARM templates provision:
  - Ubuntu VMs (16.04 primarily; some 14.04 in samples), NSGs, VNET/subnets, NICs, public IPs with DNS labels, storage accounts for boot diagnostics.
  - NSGs open 22 (SSH), 8080 (OrderService), 9080 (Web UI). Puppet Master template opens additional 443, 8140, 61613.
  - VM sizes: Standard_A2 (MRP), Standard_A3 (Puppet Master).
  - Extensions:
    - CustomScriptForLinux to install dependencies (install_updates.sh; install_mrp_dependencies_1604.sh; Puppet/Chef installers).
    - VMAccessForLinux for credentials.
    - DockerExtension on base Ubuntu templates.
- Configuration management:
  - Chef cookbook (mrpapp-2/default.rb):
    - Installs OpenJDK 8 via PPA, MongoDB, Tomcat7 (port configurable), seeds MongoDB, deploys mrp.war, downloads and starts ordering-service-0.1.0.jar (kills existing).
  - Puppet module (mrpapp):
    - configuremongodb (install + seed once via /tmp/initcomplete), configurejava (OpenJDK 8), create tomcat user/group, configuretomcat (port 9080, admin users: “tomcat”/“tomcat7” both with password “password”, manager roles), deploywar, orderingservice (download jar, stop running, start, wait 20s, restart tomcat).
- Windows deployment helpers:
  - PowerShell using PuTTY: SSH-MRP-Artifacts.ps1 to upload artifacts and trigger deploy on Linux VM; SSH-MRP-BDD-Security.ps1 to run remote BDD-security tests and fetch results.

B) Docker-based
- Images:
  - Database: FROM mongo; copies MongoRecords.js; runs mongod --rest; exposes 27017, 28017.
  - Order: FROM openjdk:8-jre; includes run.sh (waits for mongo at mongo:27017 using curl loop); exposes 8080.
  - Clients: FROM tomcat:7-jre8; copies mrp.war to webapps; exposes 8080.
- Orchestration scripts:
  - BuildAndRun.sh builds images and runs containers:
    - db: exposes 27017, 28017.
    - order: exposes 8080; linked to db as “mongo”.
    - web: maps host 80 → container 8080.
  - StopAndRemove.sh stops/removes containers/images.
- Connectivity:
  - OrderService reads Mongo host from env var MONGO_PORT for Docker link-style host resolution.

C) Azure Stack Marketplace and Lab assets
- ARM templates for:
  - Jenkins standalone VM, Chef Server standalone VM, combined Jenkins+MRP solution.
  - Ubuntu base templates with Docker.
- Ansible lab playbooks:
  - VM creation (CentOS), httpd/nginx deployment, cron, ARM deployments, infrastructure samples (load balancer, vnet, availability sets).
- Notes:
  - Potential variable mismatch in an SSH MRP template (mrpNSGName vs mrpNsgName).
  - Boot diagnostics enabled using storage accounts.

8) Configuration and Operational Settings
- OrderService application.properties (prod defaults):
  - server.port=8080, management.port=8081, management.address=127.0.0.1.
  - ordering.storage=mongodb; mongodb.host=localhost; mongodb.database=ordering.
  - ordering.pingMessage and ordering.validationMessage configured (e.g., “This is version 1.0.3”).
  - ApplicationInsights.xml: DeveloperMode=true; instrumentation key must be supplied at deploy time.
- IntegrationService application.properties:
  - mrp.endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:8080/.
  - Azure Storage connection string and queue names (orders, product); message visibility timeout=300s.
  - Logging to integration-service.log.
- Web UI serverconfig.js:
  - baseAddress points to http://<hostname>:8080; ensure this aligns with deployment topology (Tomcat often on 9080 for UI; API on 8080).
- Chef/Puppet:
  - Tomcat HTTP connector set to 9080; NSGs open 9080.
  - Tomcat manager users default credentials are insecure (training only).

9) Testing and Quality
- OrderService tests:
  - Unit tests with in-memory repositories (RepositoryFactory.reset("memory")).
  - Integration tests with MongoDB (RepositoryFactory.reset("mongodb")); test DB “orderingtest”.
- Sample DevOps assets:
  - BDD-Security runner via SSH script (optional).
  - Python CI sample with unittest via Travis CI.
  - Flask sample + Locust load tests (GET/POST /tests), independent of Java services.
- APM/Lab behavior:
  - DealerController GET /dealers executes 100000 repository calls to create database load for monitoring labs.

10) Security, Reliability, and Observability Considerations
- Security risks:
  - Azure Storage account key committed in IntegrationService application.properties (must be removed/rotated).
  - CORS wide open; no auth/authorization on OrderService endpoints.
  - Tomcat manager users with weak default credentials in Puppet config.
  - MongoDB REST interface (28017) exposed in Docker; not recommended for production.
  - NSGs in examples allow broad ingress (training scenarios).
- Reliability:
  - Minimal retry logic for Mongo (single retry on socket timeouts) with telemetry; no broader circuit-breaking.
  - IntegrationService uses at-least-once processing without idempotency keys; partial failures may create duplicates/inconsistencies.
  - Scheduled pollers are single-threaded per task; throughput limited by 30s cadence and per-message processing.
- Observability:
  - Application Insights request and exception telemetry in OrderService via AppInsightsFilter.
  - Mongo dependency telemetry captured per operation (name, duration, success).
  - Ping endpoint returns health/config/build information.

11) Ports, Endpoints, and Network Security Groups
- OrderService REST API: port 8080 (exposed publicly via NSG).
- OrderService management (Actuator): 8081 bound to 127.0.0.1.
- Web UI (Tomcat):
  - VM deployments: port 9080 (app accessible at http://<host>:9080/mrp).
  - Docker: container 8080 mapped to host 80 (by provided run script).
- MongoDB: 27017 (native), 28017 (REST; Docker only).
- IntegrationService: no inbound HTTP; background tasks only.
- SSH: 22 open on VMs.
- Puppet Enterprise (optional): 443 (console), 8140 (agent), 61613 (MCollective).

12) Critical Behaviors and Business Rules to Preserve
- IDs and uniqueness:
  - Dealers keyed by name; Catalog by skuNumber; Quotes by quoteId (server can generate); Orders one-per-Quote (“order-{quoteId}”); Shipments one-per-Order keyed by orderId.
- Status and events:
  - Order status transitions append events; controller overwrites event dates with current timestamp for both added events and status updates.
- Error semantics:
  - Catalog POST uses 409 on duplicate; Quotes POST uses 400 on duplicate; Orders creation uses 409 on duplicate; Shipments POST uses 400 on duplicate or invalid state.
  - List endpoints may return 404 when empty.
- Shipments filtered by related Order status; no separate shipment status.
- Cross-repo invariants:
  - Quote upsert creates missing Dealer automatically.
  - Order creation requires existing Quote and enforces uniqueness.
  - Shipment creation requires existing Order and enforces uniqueness.
- Mongo read quirk: CatalogItem leadTime reported as 0 when inventory > 0.

13) Microservice Decomposition Guidance
- Natural bounded contexts (candidate services with separate data ownership and APIs):
  - Catalog Service: CRUD on catalog items.
  - Dealer Service: CRUD on dealers.
  - Quote Service: quote lifecycle and search; depends on dealer validity; may publish QuoteCreated events.
  - Order Service: order lifecycle, status updates, and events; consumes QuoteCreated; enforces 1:1 with quote.
  - Shipment Service: shipment record and events; consumes OrderCreated/StatusChanged; enforces 1:1 with order.
  - Delivery/Tracking Query Service: aggregated read model (shipment + order + quote) for deliveries.
  - Integration (Anti-Corruption) Service: message-driven bridging to external website queues.
  - Web UI: static content served independently (CDN or app server), consuming APIs via an API gateway.
- Decomposition considerations:
  - Replace in-process repository calls with inter-service APIs or event-driven denormalization.
  - Materialize read models (e.g., deliveries) to avoid cross-service joins.
  - Introduce idempotency keys and saga/outbox patterns for IntegrationService flow (Quote → Order → Shipment).
  - Externalize configuration via environment variables; remove sed edits to server.xml.
  - Harden security (authN/Z, CORS restrictions, secrets management, secure NSGs; remove Mongo REST).
  - Expand resilience (client-side retries with backoff, circuit breakers; timeouts; bulkheads).
  - Use service discovery/user-defined Docker networks instead of legacy --link; migrate to orchestrators (Kubernetes) if desired.
  - Consider splitting OrderService persistence per service and applying schema-per-service (collections/tables) with strict ownership.
