| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clients/Web (Frontend SPA)** | Provides UI for the entire MRP workflow (Catalog, Dealers, Quotes, Orders, Deliveries). Orchestrates client-side data joins to create composite views. | RESTful HTTP (AJAX) calls to `OrderService` via a global `Data` object (`js/data.js`). Integrates with Google Maps Places API. | `OrderService` | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WinJS UI toolkit, Page Control Pattern |
| **OrderService (Backend Monolith)** | Core backend service providing a REST API for all business domains (Catalog, Dealer, Quote, Order, Shipment).

| **IntegrationService** | Acts as an Adapter/Anti-Corruption Layer. Polls an Azure queue for external orders to create in the MRP system, and polls the OrderService for catalog updates to push to another queue. | Makes REST API client calls to `OrderService` (`/catalog`, `/quotes`, `/orders`).<br>Communicates with two message queues (`orders`, `product`). | `OrderService`, `Azure Storage Queues` | Java 8, Spring Boot (`@EnableScheduling`), Microsoft Azure Storage SDK, Gradle, Adapter Pattern, Asynchronous Polling |
| **MongoDB (Primary)** | Primary persistent data store for all business entities. Manages collections for catalog, dealers, quotes, orders, and shipments. | MongoDB wire protocol. Accessed by `OrderService` via `MongoTemplate`. | N/A (Foundational component) | MongoDB (NoSQL Document Store) |
| **PostgreSQL Schema (Legacy/Alternative)** | Defines a fully relational schema for the application's data models. It is not used by the running application but serves as an architectural reference. | SQL DDL script (`scripts/schema.psql`). Defines tables and foreign key relationships. | N/A | PostgreSQL (Relational Database Schema) |
