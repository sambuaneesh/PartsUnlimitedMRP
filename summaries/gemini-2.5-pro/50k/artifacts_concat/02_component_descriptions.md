| Component Name | Responsibility | Interfaces (key endpoints or methods) | Depends On (other modules) | Technologies (frameworks, DBs, patterns) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web UI / MRP Client** | Provides a Single Page Application (SPA) for users to manage catalog items, dealers, quotes, orders, and deliveries. Enforces the business workflow of Quote -> Order -> Delivery. | Makes asynchronous REST calls (`WinJS.xhr`) to the Order Service API (e.g., `GET /api/catalog`, `POST /api/orders?fromQuote={quoteId}`). Integrates with Google Maps Places API for address autocompletion. | `Order Service`, Google Maps Places API | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WinJS, Date.js, SPA, MVVM-like pattern, Gradle (build) |
| **Order Service** | Core monolithic backend service. Manages all business logic and CRUD operations for the primary domains: Catalog, Dealers, Quotes, Orders, and Shipments. Provides a REST API for the UI and other services. | Exposes a comprehensive REST API (e.g., `GET /catalog`, `POST /quotes`, `PUT /orders/{id}/status`, `GET /shipments`). Health check at `/ping`. | `MongoDB` (primary), `PostgreSQL` (supported alternative), `Azure Application Insights` | Java 8, Spring Boot, Spring Data, Gradle, Apache Tomcat, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Repository Pattern, Factory Pattern, Decorator Pattern |
| **Integration Service** | A background/headless service acting as an adapter between an external system ("Parts Unlimited Website") and the Order Service. Polls queues for new orders and product updates, transforms data, and calls the Order Service API. | Consumes messages (e.g., `OrderMessage`) from an Azure Storage Queue (`orders` queue). Produces messages (e.g., `ProductMessage`) to another Azure Storage Queue (`inventory` queue). Makes REST calls to the Order Service API. | `Order Service`, `Azure Storage Queues` (or other message queue system) | Java 8, Spring Boot, Gradle, Scheduled Tasks, Polling Consumer pattern, Adapter / Anti-Corruption Layer pattern |
| **Infrastructure & Deployment Scripts** | A suite of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Configuration Management (CM) scripts for provisioning cloud infrastructure and deploying the entire application stack onto VMs and containers. | N/A (Scripts, templates, and playbooks executed by DevOps tools). | Microsoft Azure, Docker, GitHub (for artifacts) | Azure ARM Templates, Docker (`Dockerfile`), Ansible, Chef, Puppet, PowerShell, Shell scripting, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) |
| **DevOps Tooling Examples** | Self-contained example projects demonstrating specific DevOps practices like Continuous Integration and load testing for educational purposes. | A minimal Python/Flask REST API (`/tests`) for the load testing example. A `.travis.yml` file for the CI example. | Travis CI, Locust framework | Python, Flask, Travis CI, Locust |
